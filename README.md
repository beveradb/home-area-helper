Tools to help me build filters and alerts for properties I may want to live in at various points in my life, e.g. by factoring in area-specific desires such as:

- areas which are in the top 20% "least deprived" areas according to the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivations (https://simd.scot) or English Index of Multiple Deprivations (http://dclgapps.communities.gov.uk/imd/iod_index.html)
- areas which are within a 15 minute walk from a desired location (e.g. workplace)
- areas which are within a 30 minute public transport travel time from a desired location (e.g. workplace)
